Mybrother and I both love being on the water, so while my brother was deciding onwhich university to attend, TAMUG was the perfect fit as it was near the waterand offered smaller class sizes while maintaining a big sense of communitythrough the Aggie family. I have always looked up to both my brother andsister, but after spending some time in Galveston with my brother, I knew thatthat was the university I wanted to attend. I have watched my brother matureimmensely in just the one semester he has been at Galveston as a member of theMaritime Academy, and I aspire to be able to study with him once again, as wedid in high school. My brother and I have always pushed each other to be thebest that we could be, and being able to attend Texas A&M University atGalveston would be the greatest honor.

In 1996, they moved to Arlington and joined the Arlington YachtClub and the Ft. Worth Boat Club where we have been sailing ever since (metAlex Schwinn there who is now on the Sailing Team at TAMUG. Dad did a great jobof not pushing too hard to get me to love sailing, so his taking me mostSunday's to race with him paid off and I developed my own passion for thesport.  My interests seem to gravitate towards maritime pursuits.  Other thansailing, I've recently been focusing on scuba and have secured my Master ScubaDiver certification.

The results for the biology major that bestfit me were Marine Biology, Zoology, Aquatic Biology, and Wildlife Biology.After choosing Marine Biology I researched for colleges containing thatspecific major; the results came back with numerous colleges containing adegree for Marine Biology. Not many outcomes were close to home, therefore,narrowing down a majority of colleges for me to be able to attend. Of course,like any other individual I was not excited about my limited options. That wasuntil I came across Texas A&M University at Galveston. After exploring thehomepage of their website I was actually excited and looking forward toattending a college close to home. Especially, after finding out they have oneof the top Marine Biology program in Texas. All in all, this is how I learnedabout Texas A&M University at Galveston.",2017,Applicants,"(80,90]",Applicant
